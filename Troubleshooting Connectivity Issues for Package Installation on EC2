The EC2 was not able to access the internet.
so we configure the outbound traffic for that EC2 and configure these specification:
Go to the security group's Outbound rule and edit the outbound rule.
Type: All Traffic
Protocol: ALL
Port range: ALL
Destination: Custom (0.0.0.0/0)


and SAVE RULEs.

the issue will be resolve.
for verification we can ssh into the ec2 and now we can install the package.
and the issue will be resolved.
