First we have to add codecommit repo on aws cosole.
Or we can use this command 
aws codecommit create-repository --repository-name <Name of the repo> --repository-description "Description of the repo">

Add root user’s SSH public key from public key from the “aws client” to the IAM user.
Upload the public id_rsa.pub key to the IAM user, we can use command on aws client or by console command for retrieve the key present on aws clinet.
Cat /root / .ssh / id_rsa.pub

command for upload the key from aws client to the IAM user .
Aws iam upload-ssh-public-key –user-name <IAM user name>  --ssh-public-key-body “enter the key retrieve from this command “Cat /root / .ssh / id_rsa.pub”

Create the “config” file on “/root/.ssh” location .
Vi / root / .ssh / config 
Host git-codecommit.*.amazonaws.com
  User <User Id created after uploaded the key on IAM>
  IdentityFile ~/ .ssh / id_rsa.pub

Now cd / root
git clone <ssh url present on the codecommit repo >
enter to that cloned repo 
create a file
git status
git add .
Git config –global user.email “your email”
git config –global user.name “myname”
git commit -m “file added”
git status 
git push.
